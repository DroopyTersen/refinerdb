# RefinerDB

RefinerDB is a javascript library for building advanced filters. The goal is to make it as easy
as possible to create that "Amazon Shopping" refiner experience.

RefinerDB is a headless library, aka it makes zero assumptions about your UI. It plays nicely with:
- Tailwind css
- Bootstrap
- React's CSS in JS frameworks
- Or anything else you might have going on
