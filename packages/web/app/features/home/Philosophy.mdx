<h3 className="text-primary">RefinerDB runs completely in the browser.</h3>

- **No replicating your data**. RefinerDB doesn't care where your data comes from or what it looks like, it just
  expects an array of items with a primary key.
- **It's really fast** because there are no network
  calls to make with each change in criteria.

<h3 className="text-primary">RefinerDB is headless.</h3>

- RefinerDB does not make any assumptions about your UI.
- RefinerDB aims to take full control of the "behavior" but the the presentation completely up to you.
- This means RefinerDB is fully compatible with any styling technique (component libraries like MUI, TailwindCSS, CSSinJS libraries etc...)
