<h2 id="not-a-fit">When is RefinerDB not a fit?</h2>
RefinerDB is designed and tuned to simplify simple scenarios, not power Walmart.com. It is
a niche tool for when your data isn't at a scale to justify ANOTHER 3rd party service or database.
RefinerDB's sweet spot is a dataset with 100-10,000 items.

- Anthing smaller and you might be better off just rolling your own solution with simple filter functions
