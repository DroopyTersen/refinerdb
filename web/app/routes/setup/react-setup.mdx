# React Setup

`refinerdb-react` is a React wrapper around the core engine, `refinerdb`.

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

```sh
npm install refinerdb-react
```

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>

import InteractiveDemo from "../../features/sandpack/InteractiveDemo";

1. Define your indexes (see `indexes.ts`)
2. Wrap you app in a `RefinerDBProvider` (see `App.tsx`)
3. Refine the items (see `refiners.tsx`)
4. Display the results (see `ResultsView.tsx`)

_The following example is interactive! Play around with it!_

<InteractiveDemo slug="quick-start-react" />

## Philosophy

- It is a headless framework that provides a suite of custom hooks
- It does not make any assumptions about what things how things should look
- This leaves the UI compeletely up to you and means `refinerdb-react` is compatible
  with any UI framework or styling technique (ex: CSS in JS).
