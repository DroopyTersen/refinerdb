# React Setup

`refinerdb-react` is a React wrapper around the core engine, `refinerdb`.

- It is a headless framework that provides a suite of custom hooks
- It does not make anyassumptions about what things how things should look
- This leaves the UI compeletely up to you and means `refinerdb-react` is compatible
  with any UI framework or styling technique (ex: CSS in JS).

## Installation

```sh
npm install refinerdb-react
```
