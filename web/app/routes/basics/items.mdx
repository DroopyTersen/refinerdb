# Insert Items

Once you have a database instance you can seed it with an array of items.

```ts
let refinerDB = new RefinerDB("movies");
let movies = await getMovies();
refinerDB.setItems(movies);
```

- The items can be in any shape. But each item needs to have a property that represents the primary key.
  - The primary key can be an `string` or a `number`
- By default RefinerDB assumes that property is `id`
- When creating a database, you can explicitely tell RefinerDB what the primary key is using the `idProperty` setting.

```ts
let refinerDB = new RefinerDB("bookmarks", { idProperty: "__id" });
```
