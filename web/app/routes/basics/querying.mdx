# Querying the database

To query, create a `filter` object, where each each property on the object maps to a registered Index key.

In the following example, we are looking for movies where:

- `genre` is "Action" or "Comedy"
- `title` includes "day"
- `score` is greater or equal to 6

```javascript
// Each property on the filter should match a registered index key
let filter = {
  genre: ["Action", "Comedy"],
  title: "day*",
  score: { min: 6 },
};

// Pass the filter to the `query(criteria)` method
let { items, refiners } = await refinerDB.query({ filter });
```

## Exact Equals

```javascript
// Find Action movies
let filter = { genre: "Action" };
```

Pass multiple values and they will be `OR`'d together.

```javascript
// Find movies with a genre of Action or Comedy
let filter = { genre: ["Action", "Comedy"] };
```

If you add multiple indexes to the filter, they will be `AND`'d together.

```javascript
// Find all Action or Horror movies rated PG-13
let filter = { genre: ["Action", "Horror"], mpaa: "PG-13" };
```

Number Indexes work the same way

```javascript
// Find anything with a score of exactly 7.1
let filter = { score: 7.1 };
```

_See below for the min/max filter that may be more useful for Number indexes_

## String contains

You can query `IndexType.String` indexes using a 'contains' by including an `*` (asterisk) in your filter value.

```javascript
// Put an asterisk at the end to do a "contains" query

// Find any movies with 'day' anywhere in the title
let filter = { title: "day*" };

// Find any movies with 'day' or 'night' anywhere in the title
let filter = { title: ["day*", "night*"] };
```

## Min Max

You can query `IndexType.Number` and `IndexType.Date` indexes using a min/max range.

```javascript
// Find all movies with a score greater or equal to 7
let filter = {
  score: { min: 7 },
};

// Find all movies released in 2012 with score less than 5
let filter = {
  released: {
    min: new Date("1/1/2012"),
    max: new Date("12/31/2012"),
  },
  score: { max: 5 },
};
```
